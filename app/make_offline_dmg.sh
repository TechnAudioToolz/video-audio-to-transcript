Transcript Maker

1. Drag "Transcript Maker" onto the Applications folder.
2. Open it from Applications.

The first time, macOS may say it can't check the app for malicious software. That's because
this free app isn't registered with Apple. To open it anyway:

   System Settings > Privacy and Security > scroll down > "Open Anyway"

You only need to do this once.

This is the offline edition: the speech recognition, speaker and sound clean-up models are inside
the app, so it needs no internet connection. Your videos and transcripts never leave your Mac.
The first transcript takes a minute or two longer while macOS prepares the models for this Mac.

Needs macOS 14 Sonoma or newer, on a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or later).

Inside: Parakeet speech recognition (NVIDIA, CC-BY-4.0) and pyannote speaker models, run through
FluidAudio (Apache 2.0); LocalVQE (Apache 2.0); FFmpeg 7.1 (GPL, source at https://ffmpeg.org).
